# Comparative-Analysis-of-Shortest-Path-Algorithms-in-Weighted-Graphs

## Key Points of the Code:
* Graph Representation: The graph is represented as an adjacency list using an Edge class.
## * Dijkstra's Algorithm:
-> Uses a priority queue to find the shortest path.
-> Assumes non-negative edge weights.
## * Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
-> Iteratively relaxes all edges.
-> Detects negative weight cycles.
-> Performance Measurement: Execution time of each algorithm is calculated using System.nanoTime().
